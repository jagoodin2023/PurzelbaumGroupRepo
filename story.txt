The young engineer stepped out of the plane onto the landing strip and faced the Flughafen.  
His gaze turned to the terminal, as he wondered to himself, "I wonder if the bratwurst is good here."
It was his first trip into Germany through this Flughafen, he pondered as he exited onto the street.
He got in a taxi, a 2020 BMW, and asked to be taken to the nearest Biergarten.
In the Baeckerei next door he ordered a Mehlhase Gebaeck and Apfelkuchen.
As he ate, he thought about life back in Raesfeld, and about how far he'd come now that he was in Charlotte, NC, home of the Galactic Alliance regional extension open the first Tuesday morning of every April, by appointment.
His hund was with him back then and he always loved taking him to new places such as this.
His snack rejuvenated him, and he felt his wettbewerbsfaehig nature returning.
As he stood up, however, his lederhose ripped!
He quickly ran to the bathroom with his suitcase to change, and frantically slid the schloss shut.
Alongside his suitcase, a glorious Apfelkuchen was removed from said suitcase and was perfect for eating.
